# WebApi_CodeQuiz
For this project we were required to use the fundamentals of Javascript to create a page that presents the user with a timed quiz and stores their scores on the page.

# Instructions

- Click the "Start Quiz" Button to initiate the quiz
    * The timer will start at 60 seconds and count down from there until it reaches 0 then the quiz will be over.

-  A series of 5 questions will then run on the page and the user will have a choice of 4 answers to choose from in order to get the question right.
    * A correct answer awards the user with 10 points
    * A wrong answer deducts 10 points

- When the questions are all answered the quiz will end and the page will display the user's score

- The user will then be presented with a form to submit their name which will add them to the High-Score list.
